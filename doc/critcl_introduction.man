[section {History & Motivation}]

CriTcl started life as an experiment by Jean-Claude Wippler and was a self-contained Tcl
package to build C code into a Tcl/Tk extension on the fly. It was somewhat inspired by
Brian Ingerson's [term Inline] for [term Perl], but is considerably more lightweight.

It is for the last 5% to 10% when pure Tcl, which does go a long way, is not sufficient
anymore. I.e. for

[enum] when the last bits of performance are needed,

[enum] hiding critical pieces of your library or application, and
[enum] simply needing features provided only by C.

[section Overview]

The following sections first reference a few related documents which may or may not be of
interest to the audience, depending on the exact role of the reader, i.e. just a plain
user of the system, trying to get and build/install it, or going deep into the internals
for either edification or modification.

[para] This is followed by an introduction to the modes of operation supported by the
system, and its general architecture as seen by a user.
